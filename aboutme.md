Hi, I am Bhargav. I am currently a physics PhD research scholar working in the Functional Oxide Research group at Department of Physics, Saurashtra University, Rajkot, Gujarat, INDIA.

During my postgraduate studies at Sardar Patel University, I cultivated a passion for experimental solid state physics as well as Instrument automation and interfacing. Nowadays, I am working in the field of spintronics research which involves control and manipulation of spin state of electrons in semiconducting materials by the application of electric and/or magnetic field.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
