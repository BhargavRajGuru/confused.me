Technology has been changing very fast. It is difficult to manage and organize useful resources found on the web. It has become nearly impossible to locate the logs of experiments done in lab. This site helps me to organize the work done at my research lab at the Department of Physics, Saurashtra University, Rajkot, INDIA. As I am also trying to develop a small-scale lab at my home, I will be sharing my ideas, mistakes and hurdles I faced during all this work.

I will be posting here a lot of interesting stuff on science experiments and scientific computation.
